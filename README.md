# Iris Web Application (Machine Learning Model Deployment)

The goal of this project was to create an end-to-end data product by deploying a simple machine learning model. I used Flask to create the web application, Docker to containerize it, Travis CI to automate the deployment in case of any changes, and AWS ECS (Elastic Container Services) to store the app.

The model was trained based on the classical Iris dataset created by R. A. Fischer, included in scikit-learn within the dataset module.
